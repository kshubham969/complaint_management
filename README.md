# complaint_managementThe website is used to manage the complaints in any campus.
There are three actors: customer, employee and admin.
Each actor can have access to the website with the help of a login id and password.
Whenever a complaint is registered by the customer(student), it gets updated in the database and admin after determining the type of complaint (hardware or software) assigns it to the respective employee. 
After fixing the issue, the employee updates the status of the complaint and sends it to the admin and the customer.
The employee having minimum workload is assigned the task.
